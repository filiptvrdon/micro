# 📸 FINITE. - Product Thesis
Life is finite. Don't waste it on screens.

## 🎯 Core Optimization
- **Signal density** over noise.
- **Completion** over infinite consumption.
- **Reflection** over reaction.
- **Retention of ideas** over disposable thoughts.

## 🧠 Philosophy
- **Train. Log it. Leave.**
- **Micro-purpose**: Is it for documenting? For witnessing? For accountability? Yes. It's for documenting what matters and witnessing the progress of others with intentionality.
- **Boundaries**: Reintroducing boundaries to social interaction. Calm. Principled. Confident. No outrage required.
- **Finite Concept**: Finite doesn't just mean "short." It means:
  - A feed you can complete.
  - Conversations that persist.
  - Content designed to be revisited.
  - A daily boundary.
  - Intentional curation instead of algorithmic spray.
- **Persistence**: "If it mattered, it should still be there tomorrow."
- **Contrast**: Infinite feeds produce disposable thoughts. Finite spaces produce considered ones.

## 👥 Audience & Behavior
- **Target**: Athletes, hobbyists, and those who train consistently.
- **Goal**: Practice documentation + community visibility + real world impact.
- **Not for**: Influencers, viral growth, or "content creator" economy.

## 🛡 Privacy & UX
- **Data**: Collect only what's required. No behavioral profiling or selling data.
- **Interface**: Calm, neutral, mobile-first, using **JetBrains Mono**. No flashy elements or autoplay.
- **Feel**: Checking a training journal, not a carnival.

## 🛠 MVP Scope (Non-Negotiable)
- **Included**: Mobile-first PWA, accounts, photo upload, short caption, chronological feed, delete own content, moderation.
- **Excluded**: Video, Stories, DM, algorithmic ranking, ads, notifications, engagement gamification.
