# 📸 Product Thesis
Deliberate sharing for training & focused communities.

## 🎯 Core Optimization
- Signal over noise | Meaningful updates
- Finite consumption | Focused communities
- **Constraint**: When the feed ends, you're done. No "slot machine" mechanics.

---

## 👥 Audience & Behavior
**Target**: Athletes, hobbyists, and those who train consistently.
**Goal**: Practice documentation + community visibility.
**Not for**: Influencers, viral growth, or "content creator" economy.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy
- **Finite Feed**: Chronological, following-based only. No "For You", suggested posts, or infinite scroll.
- **Anti-Casino**: No algorithmic ranking, vanity metrics, or addictive notifications.
- **Depth > Virality**: Encourage training notes/lessons; discourage clickbait captions.

---

## 🛡 Privacy & UX
- **Data**: Collect only what's required. No behavioral profiling or selling data.
- **Interface**: Calm, neutral, mobile-first. No flashy elements or autoplay.
- **Feel**: Checking a training journal, not a carnival.
