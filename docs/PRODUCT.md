# 📸 Project Core Principles
*Deliberate social sharing for training & focused communities*

---

## 1. Product Thesis
Core idea:
> A place to share training footage and reflections without algorithmic manipulation.

We optimize for:
* signal over noise
* meaningful updates
* finite consumption
* focused communities

When you reach the end of the feed, you’re done. No slot machine mechanics.

---

## 2. Target Use Case

Primary audience:
* Athletes
* Lifters
* Runners
* Climbers
* Martial artists
* Hobbyists who train consistently

Primary behavior:
* Share short training videos or photos
* Add short–mid length text reflections (what worked, what didn’t, lesson learned)
* Follow friends
* Check in shortly to catch up with their progress, no doom scrolling

This is not for:
* Influencers
* Viral growth
* Performance entertainment
* “Content creation economy”

This is for:
> Practice documentation + community visibility.
That’s a very different product from Instagram.

## 3. Product Philosophy

### 3.1 Finite Feed

* Chronological
* Following-based only
* No “For You”
* No suggested posts
* No autoplay
* No infinite scroll loop

When the feed ends:

> You’re done.

Design constraint:

* No bottomless engagement.

This is a strong differentiator.

---

### 3.2 Anti-Casino Design

Explicitly avoid:

* endless refresh
* algorithmic ranking
* vanity metrics arms race
* addictive notification systems
* sexualized content amplification
* ragebait dynamics

Engagement is not the north star.

Consistency is.

---

### 3.3 Depth > Virality

Encourage:

* short-mid reflections
* lessons learned
* training notes
* honest updates

Discourage:

* performative flexing
* clickbait captions
* growth hacking behavior

You’re designing for:

> Long-term personal progression, not attention spikes.

---

## 4. Privacy & Data Stance (Refined)

Privacy model is:

* We collect only what’s required to operate.
* No behavioral profiling.
* No selling data.
* No attention optimization algorithms.
* No cross-platform tracking.

Users can:

* Choose their own identity style.
* Share as much or as little personal info as they want.

The system does not:

* Extract value from their behavior.
* Turn them into a data product.

This positions you philosophically — without being preachy.

---

## 5. UX Principles (Updated)

Mobile-first, yes — but also:

* Calm interface
* Neutral design
* No flashy elements
* No overstimulating colors
* No autoplay
* Clear session boundaries

The app should feel like:

* Checking a training journal
* Not entering a carnival

---

## 6. Core Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

1. Chronological feed only.
2. Following-based content only.
3. No algorithmic ranking.
4. Finite scroll.
5. No ads.
6. No growth-hacking mechanics.
7. Simple moderation.

### 6.1 MVP Scope

#### Included
* Mobile-first web app (PWA)
* User accounts
* Photo upload
* Short caption
* Chronological feed
* Delete own content
* Basic moderation tools

#### Excluded (MVP)
* Video
* Stories
* Direct messaging
* Algorithmic ranking
* Ads
* Notifications
* Advanced analytics
* Engagement gamification

These constraints are product features.

---

## 7. Strategic Positioning

This is not:

* “Instagram but smaller.”

This is:

> Social media for people who want to train, not perform.

You’re tapping into:

* Fatigue with overstimulation
* Frustration with algorithmic feeds
* Desire for focused, high-signal communities

That’s a real niche.

---

## 8. Engineering Direction Implications

Because you don’t:

* Rank content
* Track engagement deeply
* Serve ads
* Run recommendation systems

Your architecture stays:

* simple
* low cost
* understandable
* maintainable by one engineer

The product philosophy directly reduces technical complexity.

That’s alignment between values and system design — very strong move.

---

## 9. Possible Taglines (Just to Explore Positioning)

* “Train. Share. Done.”
* “Social without the casino.”
* “See your people. Log off.”
* “Progress over performance.”
* “No algorithm. Just effort.”

---

“Exploring what social media looks like when engagement is not the primary KPI.”
