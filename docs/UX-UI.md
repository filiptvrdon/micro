1) Initial UX/UI Guidelines (v0)
   Product feel

Calm and intentional. “Check friends’ training, then log off.”

Photos/videos are the hero. UI should recede.

Reading-friendly. Captions are short–mid length and should feel like notes/journaling.

Layout principles

* Mobile-first design
* Generous whitespace
* Photos are the primary visual element
* UI should disappear behind content
* Avoid clutter
* Fast loading
* No dark patterns

Design bias:

> Calm > addictive
> Elegant > flashy
> Focused > feature-rich

Mobile-first: 360–430px width is the primary canvas.

Single column feed with strong vertical rhythm.

Large media cards with minimal chrome:

media

author + timestamp

text reflection

small actions (like / comment optional, no view count)

Interaction principles (anti-casino)

No autoplay in feed (tap to play)

No infinite loop feeling:

show “You’re caught up” state

optional “Come back tomorrow” copy

No aggressive notifications

No “suggested for you”

Typography & tone

Text should read like training notes:

comfortable line height

slightly larger body

muted metadata

Avoid loud accent colors; use one accent as a “confirm” / “primary action” color.

UI components you’ll use early

Card

Button

Tabs or Segmented control (optional)

Dialog / Sheet (upload flow)

Toast

Avatar

Dropdown menu

2) Visual Theme Direction (calm + athletic)
   Theme goals

Neutral base (almost-white or near-black)

Soft borders, not heavy shadows

One accent color (e.g., “training green” or deep blue)

Rounded corners: medium-high (not bubbly)

Consistent spacing

Recommended tokens

Radius: 0.75rem (12px)

Border: subtle (1px, low contrast)

Shadow: minimal (only for elevation, not decoration)
