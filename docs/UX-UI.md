# 🎨 FINITE. - UX/UI Guidelines

## 🕊 Product Feel
Calm. Principled. Confident. "Train. Log it. Leave."
No outrage required. Reintroducing boundaries.
Higher signal density, higher intentionality, higher reflection per minute.

## 📐 Layout Principles
- **Mobile-First**: 360–430px is primary canvas.
- **Content-Hero**: UI recedes; photos/videos are primary.
- **Vertical Rhythm**: Single column feed with generous whitespace.
- **Minimal Chrome**: Media cards show media, author/time, reflection, and small actions.

## 🧠 Interaction (Anti-Casino)
- **No Autoplay**: Tap to play only.
- **FINITE.** Feed: Show "You're caught up" state; no "suggested for you".
- **Typography**: **JetBrains Mono** (default); user-selectable; reading-friendly; captions feel like training journal notes.

## 🛠 Components (shadcn/ui)
Card, Button, Tabs, Dialog/Sheet, Toast, Avatar, Dropdown.

## 🎨 Visual Theme
- **Base**: Neutral (near-white or near-black).
- **Accents**: One primary "confirm" color (e.g., training green/blue).
- **Style**: Rounded corners (12px), subtle borders (1px), minimal shadows.
