# 🎨 UX/UI Guidelines

## 🕊 Product Feel
Calm and intentional. "Check friends' training, then log off."

## 📐 Layout Principles
- **Mobile-First**: 360–430px is primary canvas.
- **Content-Hero**: UI recedes; photos/videos are primary.
- **Vertical Rhythm**: Single column feed with generous whitespace.
- **Minimal Chrome**: Media cards show media, author/time, reflection, and small actions.

## 🧠 Interaction (Anti-Casino)
- **No Autoplay**: Tap to play only.
- **Finite Feed**: Show "You're caught up" state; no "suggested for you".
- **Typography**: Reading-friendly; captions feel like training journal notes.

## 🛠 Components (shadcn/ui)
Card, Button, Tabs, Dialog/Sheet, Toast, Avatar, Dropdown.

## 🎨 Visual Theme
- **Base**: Neutral (near-white or near-black).
- **Accents**: One primary "confirm" color (e.g., training green/blue).
- **Style**: Rounded corners (12px), subtle borders (1px), minimal shadows.
