# Project Guidelines

This is a mobile-first, privacy-first photo sharing application inspired by the simplicity and focus of early Instagram.

## Core Principles

- **Photos Only**: The MVP focuses exclusively on high-quality photo sharing. Video content is out of scope to maintain simplicity and reduce infrastructure costs.
- **Simple Feed**: A clean, chronological feed that prioritizes visual content without algorithmic manipulation or complex discovery features.
- **Pseudonymity**: Users can interact using pseudonyms. Real-name verification is not required, and we minimize the link between digital and physical identities.
- **Ethical Design**: 
    - No tracking or behavioral analytics.
    - No advertisements.
    - No dark patterns designed to maximize "engagement" or "time spent."
- **Low Operational Overhead**: The system is designed to be cost-effective and easy to maintain for a small-scale community.

## Technical & Legal Framework

- **EU-Hosted Infrastructure**: All servers and data storage must be located within the European Union to ensure jurisdictional clarity and align with privacy values.
- **GDPR-Friendly by Design**: Privacy is not an afterthought. Data minimization, purpose limitation, and user rights are baked into the architecture.
- **Data Minimization**: The system must avoid collecting personal or sensitive data wherever possible. If data isn't essential for the service, it isn't collected.
- **No Profiling**: We do not build user profiles or perform behavioral analytics. Users are treated as individuals, not data points.

## Priorities

1. **Simplicity**: Minimalist UI and straightforward functionality.
2. **Privacy**: Protecting user identity and data is paramount.
3. **Visual Quality**: Ensuring photos look great and are the center of attention.
4. **Community**: Optimized for a small-scale, high-trust community of hundreds of users rather than mass-market scale.
